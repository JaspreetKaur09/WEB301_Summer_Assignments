  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
  <p>Everyone should have some form of hobby.
    It not only enriches us but also provides the vital energy boost to propel in our professional life as well.
    well, my hobby is gardening. It brings me in touch with the green plants and flowers and filled my lungs
    with
    pure Oxygen.I feel relaxed
    while i'm watering my plants or sitting near them.
    The great pleasure we get from planting, growing flowers and some vegetables of the season is not comparable
    with any other feelings.I had made differents pots from olf bottles and buckets by painting them.</p>
